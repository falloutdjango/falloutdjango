## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Joni Jussila and I'm currently studying at LAB University of Applied Sciences.  

**falloutdjango/falloutdjango** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at Pihlajalinna
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Salesforce at work, and to become Bachelor of Engineering, Information and Communications Technology (ICT)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on various projects at school
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning to code
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about everything.. You can always ask, but I'm not sure if I can answer for you question. :D
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Joni.Jussila@student.lab.fi
- âš¡ Fun fact: Serious movie geek
